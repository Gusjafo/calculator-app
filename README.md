## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap CSS framework



### What I learned

I had two great difficulties to carry out this project. 

* The first was the positioning with Bootstrap since I had problems in positioning the two columns. 

* The second and unexpected difficulty was entering the point in the mobile device. The solution that I implemented was to set as a point any value that is different from a number.

function onlyNumberKeyDot(evt) {
  if (evt >= 0 && evt <= 9) {
    let inputBillPut = document.querySelector("#inputBillText").value;
    console.log(inputBillPut);
    let keyPush = evt;
    console.log(evt);
    bill = bill + keyPush;
    document.querySelector("#inputBillText").value = inputBillPut;    
    return false;
  } else
    if (evt == "Unidentified" || evt == ".") {
      bill = bill + ".";
      return false;
    } else return false;
}

This function runs when a value is entered. If it is a "." or "Identified", a "." to the final value is added.
